MilesInMyShoes
==============

AppleScript with displays the number of miles for sneakers using iCal for storage. Additionally, the program tells you the total mileage for the current month. See the [wiki](https://github.com/thedanimal/MilesInMyShoes/wiki) for more information on the programs.

Things to make this script better:

1. put the sneakers in a file

2. remove the need to put the sneaker name in iCal

3. better UI.

4. write results to a file

5. filters to show data dynamically - only certain sneakers, mileage between dates, totals like number of runs for a specific sneaker.

For another Mac and running centric program, see [Pace Converter](https://github.com/thedanimal/PaceConverter).
