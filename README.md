MilesInMyShoes
==============

AppleScript with displays the number of miles for sneakers using iCal for storage. Additionally, the program tells you the total mileage for the current month.

Things to make this script better:

1. put the sneakers in a file

2. remove the need to put the sneaker name in iCal

3. better UI.

4. write results to a file

5. filters to show data dynamically - only certain sneakers, mileage between dates, totals like number of runs for a specific sneaker.
